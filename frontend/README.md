# Windows Forms App
### Frontend (VB.NET)

The frontend of the application is built using VB.NET and consists of three forms:

1. **Form1**: The main form that provides options to view submissions and create new submissions.
2. **CreateSubmissionForm**: A form for creating and editing submissions. It includes fields for name, email, phone number, GitHub link, and stopwatch time.
3. **ViewSubmissionsForm**: A form for viewing and managing submissions. It allows users to navigate through submissions, delete submissions, edit submissions, and search for submissions by email.
